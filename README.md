# Face-Recongnition-ML
OpenCV based Face recognition software. Based on Coding Blocks webinar on Machine Learning.

# Introduction

This is a Face Recognition project which is based on Python 2.7. It uses the fundamentals of Machine Learning specifically the kNN Algorithm along with resources from OpenCV.

# Dependencies
    Python 2.7
    OpenCV(For mac,kindly use the conda/brew installer for installing OpenCV.

# Initialize
   
## Installing OpenCV on OSX

```sh
conda install -c menpo opencv
```

#Running Files

1.Run record_faces.py on the command line or a python kernal.The script will open a camera window.Stand in front of the camera until recording of the face is completed.
2.The default file where the features are stored is face_01.npy. You can change the file name if you want to store information of many persons.
3.Open the face_recognition.py file and edit your name in the dictionary value corresponding to the number in which your face was stored i.e. for face_01,add your name to '0' value in the names dictionary.
4.Run the face_recognition.py file!
